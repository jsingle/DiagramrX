		<p><a href="index.html">Diagramr-EX</a></p>
		<p>This is a brief description of how to use Diagramr-EX.  Diagramr-EX is an extension of the web application 
		<a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/12/aburka1/diagramr">Diagramr</a>.  It plots shear force, bending moment, and deflection diagrams, as well as calculates maximum normal and shearing stresses in the beam.  Plotted functions can be evaluated at specific points.  The application's state is saved in the url, and a problem can be reloaded via pasting a saved url into your browser.</p>
		<h5>Adding Loads</h5>
		<p>Loads are added by dragging a load icon onto the beam.  They can be dragged around once on the beam.  Their position can also be more exactly specified by clicking on the load's position label.  A load's magnitude can be specified by clicking on its magnitude label.</p>
		<h5>Supports</h5>
		<p>Supports can be moved via click and drag, and their position can be also be specified by clicking on the position label.  Support mode can be toggled between overhanging and cantilever by clicking on the the support mode label to the left of the beam.</p>
		<h5>Beam Length</h5>
		<p>Beam length can be entered by clicking on the length label to the right of the beam.</p>
		<h5>Cross Section</h5>
		<p>Select the cross section shape by clicking on "Select Cross Section".  Currently 3 shapes are supported: rectangle, circle, and T shape.  Edit the section's dimensions by clicking on "Set Cross Section Dimensions" at the bottom of the cross section editor.  E can be specified by clicking on its label.</p>
		<h5>Stresses</h5>
		<p>Maximum stresses are calculated and displayed to the right of the plots, along with the maximum values for the plotted functions.</p>
		<h5>Beam Length</h5>
		<p>Beam length can be entered by clicking on the length label to the right of the beam.</p>
		<h5>Evaluating Functions</h5>
		<p>To evaluate a function, click on the plot label (to the left of the plots).  The function's singularity function is also viewed in this way.</p>
		<h5>Potential Problems</h5>
		<p>This application may not work on older versions of IE.</p>
		<p>The application is pretty scalable, but won't scale down forever.  To avoid interface issues, use in a maximized browser window.  When the window gets resized, it needs to be refreshed.</p>
		<p>The plots sometimes scale horizontally incorrectly.  If this happens, try refreshing, or changing the window size then refreshing.</p>
		<p>Note: there is a bug in the undo/redo when it comes to moving support positions in combination with resizing the beam.</p>
